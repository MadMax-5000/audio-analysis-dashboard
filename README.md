# Audio Analysis Dashboard 🎧📊

## Overview
The **Audio Analysis Dashboard** is a powerful Python-based tool designed to analyze and visualize various features of audio files, including music, human voices, and animal sounds. The tool provides insights into the frequency distribution, Mel spectrograms, MFCCs, and other essential audio features. 🚀

## Features
- 🎶 **Waveform Visualization**: View the raw audio waveform.
- 🔊 **Mel Spectrogram**: Visualize the frequency content of the audio.
- 📊 **MFCCs**: Extract and visualize Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients.
- 🧠 **Delta MFCCs**: View the first derivative of MFCCs.
- 📈 **Frequency Distribution**: Analyze and compare the energy across different frequency bands.
- 🔄 **Category-based Analysis**: Choose from music, human voice, or animal sound categories for tailored feature extraction.
- 💾 **Feature Export**: Export extracted audio features as a CSV file for further analysis.
